## Description

Our main goal is creation of a functional website which can be easily customized by
developers as well as easily used by the users. Full information about the project 
and other technical details can be found in the documentaion located in the `'doc'` 
directory. Information about the Ansible deployment script can be found in the `'Ansible'`
directory.

### System Requirements (and used tools)

1. PHP 7 (or above).

2. [**CodeIgniter4**](https://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/intro/index.html) PHP framework (CI4).

> CI4 is beginner friendly and gives a stable foundation by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks
> as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. 
> It uses the MVC (Model, View, Controller) structure, which is used to control view navigation, to corral data straight
> from the models, instead of pre-building databases.

3. [**Ansible**](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).

4. [**Apache**](https://httpd.apache.org).

5. [**phpMyAdmin**](https://www.phpmyadmin.net).
