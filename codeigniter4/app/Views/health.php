<h3 class="tech-text" style="padding-bottom: 1%"> BMI calculator </h3>
<p class="tech-text">
BMI is a value derived from the weight and the height of a person. It is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2.
BMI is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height, gender or age. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation 
of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. Being overweight or underweight
can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required.
