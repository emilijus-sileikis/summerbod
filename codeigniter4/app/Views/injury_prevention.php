<h3 class="tech-text"> Injury Prevention </h3>
<p class="tech-text">
Whether you are a casual exercise enthusiast or a hardcore gym rat, getting injured while working out does not have to be an inevitable part of your workout life.
There are many ways to prevent injuries while working out and they might differ for different types of workouts, however, here are some general tips in order to
lower the risk of injuries as much as possible for both novices and professionals.
</p>

<h4 class="tech-text" style="padding-bottom: 1%">Proper Warm-Up</h4>
<p class="tech-text">
Jumping straight into your lifting or aerobics class is a surefire way to injure yourself. Cold muscles are less pliable and more prone to tearing, which can spell disaster
                    for your workout plans. Spend 5 to 10 minutes before your workout performing an active warm-up. Try to keep your body moving by walking or performing dynamic stretches
                    such as leg lifts and other movements. Slow stretches where you assume a position and hold it does not get your muscles moving enough for a proper warm-up, so avoid doing 
                    them if it is possible. For more information and some examples of proper warm-ups feel free to check out our Warm-Up section.</p>

<h4 class="tech-text" style="padding-bottom: 1%">Do Not Overdo It</h4>
<p class="tech-text">
Just because you were able to execute that heavy lift when you last trained a month ago, or were able to run for 15 minutes straight five years ago, does not mean that you are 
able to do it today. Be realistic about your current abilities and start out slowly if you are just getting into exercising or if you are starting up a new program. A couple 
of days at lower intensity while you figure out where your training sweet spot is will do much less to impede your eventual performance than starting off too hard, injuring 
yourself, and having to take several days or weeks off to recover.</p>

<h4 class="tech-text" style="padding-bottom: 1%">More Variety</h4>
<p class="tech-text">
Changing up your exercises, when done carefully and with your physical limits in mind, can actually benefit your training instead of hurting it. Our muscles get used to the 
same moves if performed over and over again, potentially leading to overuse injuries. In addition, performing the exact same routine day in and day out, may give you 
overconfidence. This may lead to people using too much weight and doing "Ego-Liftings" which can be dangerous. By switching up your training routine every so often, or even 
rotating the types of training you do every other day, you will engage and strengthen more of your muscles, giving you a better overall workout and improving your strength.</p>

<h4 class="tech-text" style="padding-bottom: 1%">Proper Technique</h4>
<p class="tech-text">
Taking the time to get a proper technique is crucial, especially for beginners. This may mean working with a professional for a few sessions, hiring a trainer or even practicing 
by yourself with smaller or even no weights at all. Improper form, especially in weightlifting, can cause serious injuries that will cause you to halt your training. Every sport 
can benefit from a little expert assistance, including aspiring runners, swimmers, or tennis players. Take things slow, learn how to properly execute the moves, and your hard work 
will pay off in the end. To see some examples of proper technique check out our Workouts section.</p>

<h4 class="tech-text" style="padding-bottom: 1%">Stay Hydrated</h4>
<p class="tech-text">
Just like with food, exercising when improperly hydrated can lead to injury. As you exercise, you sweat, releasing not only water from your body but also electrolytes that are 
important for your brain and body functions. But, just as not drinking enough water can be a bad idea, so can drinking too much, as that sloshy feeling in your stomach during 
a workout can leave you nauseated and distracted. Try to fit in 400ml-500ml of water about two hours prior to a workout, then keep a bottle of water with you for sips every 15 
minutes or so during exercise. Follow up your workout with another 400ml-500ml within two hours of finishing to replace lost fluids.</p>

<h4 class="tech-text" style="padding-bottom: 1%">Feel Your Body</h4>
<p class="tech-text">
If something hurts, stop. No pain no gain?. Well, not really. Pain is a sign that you are either doing something wrong or doing something your body is not ready for yet. 
Stop, evaluate what you did to cause the pain and either adjust your form or take a rest. You are better off backing down from a pain-inducing move than pushing through it 
and risking injury. If necessary, consult with a professional or a trainer to see if there is an adjustment you need to make in order to avoid pain.</p>

<h4 class="tech-text" style="padding-bottom: 1%">Rest Is Important</h4>
<p class="tech-text">
When you are actively chasing a fitness goal, it can seem counter-productive to take a whole day or even more away from the gym to rest. Rest days are, in fact, exactly the 
opposite: They allow your body to recuperate and your muscles to rebuild, which contribute to increased strength and growth. One full rest day every 3 to 5 workout days is 
generally recommended. Take more time off if you are experiencing excessive soreness or pain, or you just feel worn down. You are better off taking an extra day to rest now 
than risking training while overtired and injuring yourself. Starting a new exercise journey is a positive step towards overall health and wellness. Take your time, take the 
above precautions, and have fun while exploring something new.</p>


<h3 class="tech-text"> Posture </h3>

<p class="tech-text">
Bad posture is a common problem nowadays, especially among teenagers. Not only does it negatively affect your workout form, it also may have some permanent damage to your back or neck.
Teenagers belong to the most important age group in which, the body goes through many changes. Changes in the structure and posture of the body are most visible during these years. 
Identifying the causes of posture problems is very important to ensure that a teen grows into a healthy adult.
</p>

<h4 class="tech-text" style="padding-bottom: 1%">Causes Of Posture Problems:</h4>
<p class="tech-text">
Smartphones, video games, obesity and general lack of physical activity can affect your posture in different ways. You may feel more tired and look less confident as your shoulders roll in while 
the neck and back shift forward. Over time, poor posture may cause muscle strains, abnormal bone growth, and mobility issues in teenagers. What is important to understand is that posture problems during 
the teenage years can have far-reaching consequences as they transition to adulthood. So lets take a look at most common mistakes in posture below. (Images from the NHS website)</p>

<h4 class="tech-text"> Slouching in a chair </h4>
<p class="tech-text">
Slouching may not always seem uncomfortable, but over time this position can place strain on already sensitised muscles and soft tissues.
This type of strain may cause pain in muscles and lower back. Try to get a habit of sitting correctly. Initially it may not feel comfortable, but with time
it will get better.

<h4 class="tech-text"> "Donald Duck" Posture </h4>
<p class="tech-text">
The so called "Donald Duck" posture is when your bottom tends to stick out or when you have a pronounced curve in your lower back.
That means that you may have hyperlordosis which is an exaggerated inward curve of the lower back that created this posture. Wearing high heels, 
excessive weight around the stomach and pregnancy can all contribue to a "Donald Duck" posture.
</p>

<br></br>
<h4 class="tech-text"> Flat back posture </h4>
<p class="tech-text">
Flat back means your lower back is straight instead of naturally curved and your pelvis is tucked in, causing you to stoop forward. If you have
flat back it may be more difficult to stand in one place for longer periods of time. This posture is often caused by muscle imbalances, 
which encourage you to adopt such a position. Spending long periods sitting down can also contribute to a flat back.
</p>

<br></br>
<h4 class="tech-text"> Leaning on one leg </h4>
<p class="tech-text">
This position may feel comfortable, especially if you are standing for a while. But instead of using core muscles to keep you straight, you place exessive pressure on one side
of your lower back and hip. Over time, you may develop muscle imbalances around the pelvis area, which can cause muscular strain in the lower back and buttocks.
Other causes of uneven hips include carrying heavy backpacks on one shoulder, and parents carrying toddlers on one hip.

<br></br>
<h4 class="tech-text"> "Text neck" </h4>
<p class="tech-text">
Hunching over your keyboard or looking in to a phone while sitting or standing is usually a sign that you have a weak upper back. Over time, this posture can contribute to developing a rounded
upper back (a small bump on your neck), which can cause shoulder and upper back stiffness and even pain.
</p>
<a class="tech-text"><?php include('partials/base64/textback.php'); ?></a>

<br></br>
<h4 class="tech-text"> Poking your chin </h4>
<p class="tech-text">
This posture is also associated with sitting too long in front of a desk or a computer with its screen being too low. Correcting this posture requires your work place adjustments.
