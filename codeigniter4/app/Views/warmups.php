	<h3 class="warmup-text header3"> Why are they important? </h3> <p>.</p>
	<p class="warmup-text">It is very important to perform a proper warm-up before any type of physical activity. 
		The purpose of warming-up is to prevent injury by increasing the bodyâ€™s core and muscle temperature. 
		Warm muscles increase the rate of energy production which increases reflexes and lowers the time it takes to contract a muscle. 
		A good warm up should also increase range of motion and mentally prepare you for exercise.
		Warm-ups can be performed to specificifically target certain muscles, but more often than not full body warm-up is still recommended, even if you
		only plan to workout a few muscle groups. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="warmup-text">
		Summerbod provides a neat list of exercises below, so to start your workout right, pick a few warmups, which directly correlate to the muscles
		you are going to use, but dont forget to include at least one of each group regardless.
